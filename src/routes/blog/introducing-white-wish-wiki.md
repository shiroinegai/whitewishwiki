# Introducing White Wish Wiki

Hello there, and welcome to White Wish Wiki!

Thank you for coming to visit this little project of mine. As you can see, it is still very much in its early stages of development and has little to offer. One might ask what are the reasons behind making another wiki when there's already an existing one with plenty of contributors. There's several.

## Imagine what a modern game wiki could be

I have always wondered what a modern game wiki could be. Game knowledge has been shared through many forms, and I particularly adore absorbing them through game guidebooks. They would always be beautifully illustrated and a joy to flip through. I want to capture that little spark of joy with the creation of this wiki, where every article you open could be as memorable as the subject it describes.

Since this isn't limited to the confines of a physical guidebook and is a living growing website, I think a modern game wiki should take even greater advantage of that and have more ways to deliver content to users in a fun yet enlightening manner. Existing game wikis are formulaic, template-driven and can be difficult to navigate on mobile. I want this wiki to change that, to make it so that when users think of browsing a game wiki, it should be something possibly exciting to do.

## Validated, curated, and dynamic content

When it comes to browsing a game wiki, especially one of a game which has just released, information accuracy is an issue. Allowing others to contribute can be a double-edged sword despite its obvious advantage in quickly gathering information. While it may not be ideal in the short-term, White Wish Wiki aims to add information on a validation-first basis. I want users to have the confidence to know that whatever information they find here, it has been verified to be true before being published. Admittedly, game patches will typically render things inaccurate, but I definitely want everything on White Wish Wiki to be true at its time of publishing.

As White Wish Wiki grows, I would love to have others keen in the spirit of innovating game wikis to join me in crafting and curating bespoke content that enhances the users' experience when browsing the wiki. This brings me to the first piece of content that I have planned -- an interactive and dynamic walkthrough guide that can be custom-tuned to the type of spoilers you wish to avoid. This is actually a larger undertaking than it sounds and it may be quite a while before it bears fruit. When a prototype for it is available, I sincerely believe that it'll be a good companion, serving as your maiden throughout The Lands Between.

## Some personal motivations

At the time of writing this, there is only one major Elden Ring wiki that has garnered traction, namely, Fextralife's. Generally speaking, I do not like the idea of actively monetising a portal of knowledge with invasive ads or a VIP subscription. I have no personal vendetta against them but I cannot fully agree with the way it operates. Just an example of something I can't condone is how Fextralife's wiki watermarks in-game assets with their branding. Their custom wiki license should also ring several alarms for those looking to contribute there as anything you contribute would then technically become their copyright, making what should have been a community resource into something akin to a private corporate asset.

This simply isn't how I envision a modern game wiki to be. It has been some time since Elden Ring has released and there hasn't been a competing resource to rival theirs or to challenge their subtle ability to profit off their contributors. While I understand the need to raise money to keep the servers running, I do not sense complete goodwill on their part when their wiki uses a custom license instead of the Creative Commons licenses used broadly by many existing game wikis. With the creation of White Wish Wiki, I hope to challenge them to be better while also pushing the standard of what an ideal game wiki should strive for.
